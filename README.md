# cyberpug

A demo discord bot for our cooperative programming group.

You can [invite it to your own server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=825469215330271283&scope=bot)

## local development

You can develop locally:

```
npm i     # install tools & dependencies
npm start # start the server locally
```

## deployment

It's deployed on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/cyberpug) to make it easy to try out ideas and play with the server. Let me know if you want to be invited to the server. It's currently connected to our discord server, so you can see it running right away, and if you are a glitch member, you can edit stuff, directly in the browser, and see it update in realtime.
