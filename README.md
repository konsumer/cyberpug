# cyberpug

A demo discord bot for our cooperative programming group.

You can [invite cyberpug to your own discord server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=825469215330271283&scope=bot)

## local development

You can develop locally:

```
npm i     # install tools & dependencies
npm start # start the server locally
```

## deployment

It's deployed on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/cyberpug) to make it easy to try out ideas and play with the server.

The discord developer-portal is [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/825469215330271283), if you need to change the settings. Let me know if you need access.

cyberpug is currently connected to our discord server, so you can see it running right away, and on glitch, you can edit the code directly in the browser, and see it update in realtime.



## TODO

- add [automatic deploy](https://support.glitch.com/t/tutorial-how-to-auto-update-your-project-with-github/8124) so it always matches github
